# cross-stitch-pattern-builder
This repo contains the various iterations of my cross-stitch pattern builder app. It's a single HTML file that you just run locally.

**How to Use**
- Download the HTML file with the highest version number
- Open the HTML file; it should run in your browser
- Set up your pattern with the size, stitch count, orientation, and thread colors you want for your project
- Design your cross stitch pattern by clicking squares (stitches) to flip them from white to your current thread color
- Click and drag to cover multiple stitches at once
- Download your pattern when you're done
- Check out the learn to cross stitch info below the canvas if you're new to the craft
